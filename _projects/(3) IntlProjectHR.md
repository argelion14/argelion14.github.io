# IntlProjectHR

This project proposes a modular architecture capable of managing international cooperation
projects based on the software currently used by the International Relations Office of the
UGR for this purpose. Additionally, an extra module will be developed for human resources
management, especially time management in projects, implementing timesheet tools.

For this purpose, existing systems will be analysed, both modular and project management
systems, in order to obtain the necessary information to be able to develop the basis of the project.

Information such as the design that they follow or the navigability between modules will be
used to make a design proposal that meets the requirements that must be met in order to manage projects correctly.

The proposed design is then implemented by creating an application called IntlProjectHR which is supported by a database created specifically for the project.
